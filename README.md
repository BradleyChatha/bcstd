# Overview

This is mostly just a little hobby project.

This is a -betterC standard library with no dependency on libc and Phobos, for personal use. Either to kill time; as an exercise for implementing things, or just for a bit of fun.

Use it if you want, but I've only put it onto Dub to make it easier for my personal projects to use this library.

Very alpha. Very unstable. Don't trust it for any serious project if for some ridiculous reason you're using it in the first place.

Targets are x86_64 on Windows and Linux. If things work on Mac then great! But it's not something I'm going out of my way to support.

Compiler targets are DMD and LDC.
